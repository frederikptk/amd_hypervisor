# MAH: Mini AMD Hypervisor

A small AMD Hypervisor for Linux systems. It provides a small interface for creating guests, setting registers and donating memory to the guest. MAH is intended to be a minimal hypervisor without capabilities such as complex device emulation.

## Features
The features MAH provides are:
 - Donating userspace memory to the guest
 - Setting registers
 - Log of all accessed pages

## Example API usage
A small example for using MAH:
```
void scurr();
```
A more complete example can be found in the `user` folder.

## Building
Install the dependencies via:
```
sudo apt install gcc make linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```
In order to build MAH, clone the repository and execute:
```
./build.sh
```

## TODO
 - Support for multiple VCPUs and vAPIC support
